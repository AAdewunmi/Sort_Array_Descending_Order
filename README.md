# Java Arrays Challenge: Sort a list of integers in Descending Order.

This is a Java program that sorts an array of integers in descending order.
The program is set up so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
Methods implemented are: getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
- getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
- printArray prints out the contents of the array
- sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
